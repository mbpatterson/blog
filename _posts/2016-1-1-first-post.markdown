Welcome to my blog! I'm starting this blog in the new year and will hopefully post regularly about my learnings of `Configuration Management`, `Elixir/Phoenix`, and `Photography`...

For some background, I currently work with Microsoft's `System Center Configuration Manager` daily to manage 500+ workstations with patches, antivirus, application catalog, and operating system deployment. I want to expand my knowledge working with SCCM reporting, and more advanced stack administration ie adding additional site system servers and roles. Additionally I want to begin learning Linux configuration management with either Chef or Ansible. I have very little Linux background and am looking forward to expanding my skill set.

I currently know absolutely nothing about `Phoenix/Elixir`, but am interested in developing web applications. I have dabbled with JavaScript and the Meteor framework but want to head away from the JavaScript world into a better suited functional programming language.

`Photography` has been a big hobby of mine for the past 10 years. I took several classes in high school and became hooked. I no longer shoot and develop black and white film as I did back then, but have taken up digital photography and editing in Adobe Lightroom. I have recently become interested in long exposure photography and am looking forward to seeing what great compositions I can capture this year.

Future posts will be catagorized into one of those three groups but I am reserving a fourth catageory for misc for everything else.
