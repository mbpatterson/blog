I just got a new Samsung 850 Pro 512GB SSD! I had a smaller 128GB Crucial M4, but after 4 years I finally outgrew its limited storage space.

Installation proved a bit trickier than I anticipated. I have a mini ITX case and this was the 4th physical drive (2 ssd and 2 hdd) in it. I ended up having to move my CPU fan to the other side of the heatsink to get enough clearance to plug in the sata and power cable to the drive.

When I finally booted into the BIOS after getting everything wired up it would not let me select the new drive as a boot device. Launching the Windows installer from a USB drive also gave me an error that Windows could not install to the new disk. Puzzled, I turned to Google and tried a few tips such as changing from AHCI to IDE and formatting the new drive in diskpart. Neither of these worked so I went old fashioned and physically unplugged the remaining 3 drives from the system.

Booted again and the Windows installation went off without a hitch! It's hard to tell if the new drive is faster than my old one. I plan on running some storage benchmarks for fun to see for sure.
