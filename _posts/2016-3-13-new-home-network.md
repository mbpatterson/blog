I recently upgraded my home network from the default FIOS router plus consumer WAP to some enterprise Ubiquiti equipment. Specifically I'm running the EdgeRouter X, UniFi AC Lite AP, and EdgeSwitch 24 Lite. I now have my home network segmented into multiple VLANs and will detail how everything is configured in a future post. I've been running this new setup for several weeks and have been blown away by all of the features of the EdgeRouter and EdgeSwitch and the noticeable latency improvement from the UniFi AP. The entry cost is somewhat steep (~$400, but way cheaper than a comparable Cisco or Juniper setup) but I would wholly recommend for anyone with an aspiring home lab setup. If you don't need the switch ($250 by itself) then you can still greatly improve your home network with the router and WAP for a much more reasonable cost.
